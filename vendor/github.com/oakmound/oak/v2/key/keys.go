// This lists the keys sent through oak's input events.
// This list is not used internally by oak, but was generated from
// the expected output from x/mobile/key.
// todo: write a go generate script to perform said generation
//
// These strings are sent as payloads to Key.Down and Key.Up events,
// and through "KeyDown"+$a, "KeyUp"+$a for any $a in the const.
